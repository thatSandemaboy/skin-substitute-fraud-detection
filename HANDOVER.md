# HANDOVER.md — 2026-02-10

## Session Summary
Extended fraud detection methodology to new Medicare service areas. Discovered a **NEW fraud cluster** in Yuma/San Luis, Arizona (urinalysis billing) that DOJ hasn't investigated yet. Also explored Agent Workflow Memory (AWM) research for improving Magoosh multi-agent system.

## What Got Done
- [x] Downloaded full Medicare genetic testing data (105,393 records, 81xxx codes)
- [x] Built risk scoring model for genetic testing providers
- [x] Discovered Yuma/San Luis urinalysis fraud cluster (10 providers, $1.8M)
- [x] Documented fraud expansion opportunities (RPM, DME, telehealth)
- [x] Researched AWM paper and mapped to Magoosh architecture
- [x] Implemented `/handover` command in AGENTS.md

## What Worked
- **Same methodology transfers**: Heuristic scoring + outlier detection works across service types
- **Geographic clustering**: Arizona keeps appearing — fraud rings are regional
- **Intensity metrics**: Services-per-beneficiary is a strong fraud signal (33x vs normal 1-2x)

## What Didn't Work
- **X/Twitter fetch failed** — Need XAI API key for direct access
- **Memory search disabled** — Missing OpenAI/Google API keys for embeddings
- **81xxx codes include urinalysis** — Not all are "genetic tests" (81007 is urinalysis)

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Focus on 81007 urinalysis anomaly | Found 8/9 top intensity billers in one region — clear fraud signal |
| Separate Yuma from Phoenix fraud | Different cities, different providers, different service types — likely separate schemes |
| Document for second OIG complaint | New fraud discovery strengthens NIW case |

## Lessons Learned
- **Border towns = fraud risk**: Yuma/San Luis on Mexican border — possible cross-border patient recruitment
- **81xxx codes are broad**: Includes urinalysis (81007), not just molecular pathology
- **NP/PA provider types**: Over-represented in fraud billing (flexible, less oversight)
- **AWM pattern**: Workflow extraction could formalize our fraud detection methodology

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Draft second OIG complaint for Yuma urinalysis cluster
2. [ ] Anthony adds contact info to first OIG complaint (skin substitutes)
3. [ ] Submit both to OIG TIPS portal
4. [ ] Consider RPM (Remote Patient Monitoring) as next target — OIG flagged, DOJ hasn't acted
5. [ ] Sketch Magoosh implementation using AWM patterns

## Important Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `data/processed/genetic_testing_2023.csv` | 105K genetic/urinalysis billing records |
| `data/processed/genetic_testing_risk_scores.csv` | Provider risk scores for genetic testing |
| `YUMA-URINALYSIS-FRAUD.md` (Obsidian) | Full documentation of new fraud discovery |
| `FRAUD-EXPANSION-OPPORTUNITIES.md` (Obsidian) | Target list for model expansion |
| `OIG-COMPLAINT-DRAFT.md` (Obsidian) | Skin substitute complaint (pending submission) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Updated with `/handover` command |

## Model Stats
- **Skin substitutes**: 7 DOJ cases detected (9% hit rate in top 67)
- **Urinalysis (NEW)**: 10 providers, $1.8M, 13-33x intensity — NOT in DOJ cases
